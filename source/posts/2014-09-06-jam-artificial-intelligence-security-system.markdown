Jam: An Artifical Intelligence Security System
==============================================

Working by myself, I have developed the first ever artificial intelligence
autonomous security testing tool that is capable of automatically and
systematically deducing what remote vulnerabilities are possible and
in certain circumstances automatically exploiting those vulnerabilities.
It is the ultimate security testing tool as it has the expert system and
everything necessary to wreak havoc.

Sounds scary, no? It might be - and it is for sale to the highest
bidder. So where are you (NSA)[http://nsa.gov] or (BND)[http://www.bnd.bund.de/EN/_Home/Service_Box/Contact/Contact_node.html]?
Contact me [here](mailto:joe@thrallingpenguin.com).

For those technically inclined, the system is built upon C++ and SWI-Prolog.
