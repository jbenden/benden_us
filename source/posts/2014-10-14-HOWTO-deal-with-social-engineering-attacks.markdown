How-To Deal With Social Engineering Attacks
===========================================

Let's face it. There are not many better ways of getting insider
information that by social engineering attacks. They can be as
harmless as a person calling to ask for the name of the person running
the technical support department - to as complex as entering the
premise to take "spy" photos of equipment, personnel, and networking
and server "closets", all while asking important questions about the
items that they see.

So How do We Protect Ourselves?
-------------------------------

First off, never ever give a password out over the telephone. This is
rule number one when it comes to social engineering attacks. Next,
think twice before answering a question - maybe even defer the
question to someone else and inform the party that another
representative will contact them regarding their question.

The short and narrow is this. Any information given out may be used as
part of a social engineering attack. It is really this simple. So it
comes down to deciding what information the general public may have
regarding your company or department. It is also critical that
management be involved with this or unforeseen consequences of plan
will find their way in.

What's the Best Policy?
-----------------------

The best policy is to always say that information is regarded as a
company asset and is not available to the general public.

Using this method, no information leaks should be possible; unless a
slip occurs. While slips are frowned against, it is certainly better
to keep all information about your business to yourself.
