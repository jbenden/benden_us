Working closely with the [NSA](http://nsa.gov), I have developed the first ever AI
autonomous security testing device. The system called **_Jam_**, is able to
automatically and systematically deduce what remote vulnerabilities
are possible.

Sounds scary, no? It might be. However, ask yourself this question:
Who would you rather have such technology? I personally think that it
is in the best hands possible and you should think along those same
lines; however, I'm welcome to your opinion.

For those technically inclined, the system is built upon C++ and Prolog.
