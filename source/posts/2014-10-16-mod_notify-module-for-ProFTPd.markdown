mod_notify: A Module For ProFTPd
================================

*mod_notify* provides for automatic email notifications upon successful
uploads to your ProFTPd server. It accomplishes this task by interacting
with a local email server running on the local machine. It does not
handle failures in the email subsystem and instead relies on the mail
subsystem for queueing email for delivery.

Additional information about *mod_notify* may be found on its
[GitHub](https://github.com/jbenden/mod_notify) page.
