Herein I describe a system that systematically decides whether an opiate is acceptable and the type of opiate to depense, based on asking simple questions. The expert system is as knowledgeable as a pain expert.

An expert system for this decision making is imperative in an era when opiates are generally avoided. The expert system helps reassure the doctor that opiates are an acceptable solution to a real medical problem. It does this by recommending an opiate and its dosage. Furthermore, the medication is linked to the appropriate page within the PDR for quick reference.

This system is under development with contracts for usage being accepted. If you would like more information about this product or have any additional questions; please contact the author, Joseph Benden, via this web site.
