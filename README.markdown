This be something. Something alright.

This is the personal "blog" of Joseph Benden.

This website is based on an existing website, Avalonstar; however,
CSS issues and additional support code were added. (Such as image
gallery support.)

## Running the development environment

    $ NEWRELIC_ENABLE=false PORT=8080 foreman run web

The above command may be used to start the web server on port 8080.
