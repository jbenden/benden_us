**Arum Cornutum, Typhonium venosum, or Voodoo Lily** - This is an amusing
plant. It was very fun to grow and had an interesting flower, which is
shown above. This interesting flower *stinks*, really bad, but isn't as
bad as many will lead you to believe. In all of the stench, there is
the distinct "flowery" sweet smell. Strange indeed.
